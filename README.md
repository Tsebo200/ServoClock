# ServoClock
This is a code to run a servo as a clock <br>
So the code works perfectly well on the arduino nano but I am sure it should work on any arduino, I still need to make it into a function to refactor it better<br>
Please ensure that your PinOuts are set correctly with the code<br>
My servo was on pin D9 with one other pin on Ground and other on the 5V<br>
